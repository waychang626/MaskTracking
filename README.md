# MaskTracking
This is our Cogs109 Fa2020 Final Project, contributed by Waylon Chang, RickyMartin, Noemi Yepez, and Dan Kaliblotzky. 

We will be using two different CSV files from the New York Times used in their reporting on COVID. The first dataset consists of covid information per county, including number of cases, deaths, confirmed cases, confirmed deaths, probable cases, and probable deaths. We will then be comparing this data set to a secondary data set is of mask usage per county showing the results of a mask usage survey taken between July 2 and 14 used by the New York Times to show the probability someone would wear a mask in any given area. Given the significance of COVID to society right now, we definitely feel it would be interesting to explore data about it and how wearing masks may have affected it.
